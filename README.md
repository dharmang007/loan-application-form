This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Project Description

# Camino Financial's Frontend Take Home Project



Hello and welcome to Camino Financial take home project!

## The Mission

The mission, should you choose to accept, is to build a loan application page using React and Redux.

## Getting started

We suggest you use create-react-app to quickly set up your app : 
https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

## Why a take-home?

This is a tangible way for you to show us:

* That you know react and redux.
* That you're excellent at making web apps look like the designs given to you.
* That your code is extendable & easy to read.

## The Mission Specs

The images of what we'll be building are provided on this repo

#### 1: Build the page according to the mockup provided ####
* I can toggle the help header
* I can only click the NEXT button if all the required fields have been filled (we suggest you add field validation too!)

#### 2: Use React with Redux  ####
* We would like you to use Redux for state management
* Clicking 'NEXT' should update your redux store

#### 3: Build reusable components  ####
* Even though you are only building step 1 of this loan application, you might have noticed there are 3 steps total... keep this in mind when building your components!

#### 4: Test your work  ####
* Don't forget to write tests, use the testing framework of your choice

#### 5: Help us review your work ####
* Your readme should let us know how to view your app
* Please remember to commit often so we can see how you're tracking...

#### 6 (Bonus): Deploy your app to the world ####
* Deploy your app to heroku or any server of your choice for a live demo


If you have any questions, concerns or suggestions please feel free to ping us on the recruiting platform.
Happy coding! Camino Financial is a pretty awesome place to work, We hope to see you soon!
